        <h2>The History of Ice Cream: From Ancient Treats to Modern Delights</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/01.jpg" height="120px" width="120px">
        <p>The Birthplace of Ice Cream (200 BC) Ice cream-like desserts are believed to have originated in ancient
          China.
          Around 200 BC, the Chinese created a simple version of ice cream by mixing rice and milk, freezing it with
          snow.
          Additionally, there are stories of an early form of sherbet, made by combining snow with fruits and honey.
          These
          early frozen treats were reserved for the elite and were seen as luxurious indulgences.</p>

        <h2>The Science Behind Creamy Ice Cream: What Makes It So Smooth?</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/05.jpg" height="120px" width="120px">
        <p>Fat is one of the key ingredients responsible for ice cream’s creamy texture. The fats, typically from cream,
          milk, or plant-based alternatives, contribute to the richness and smoothness. Here’s how it works: </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fat Molecules: Fats coat the tiny air bubbles in the ice cream mixture during the churning process,
            preventing them from collapsing and ensuring a light, creamy texture.</li>
          <li>Emulsification: Fats emulsify (or bind) with water, creating a stable structure that traps air and
            prevents
            large ice crystals from forming, which keeps the texture smooth rather than icy.</li>

        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Without enough fat, ice cream can feel thin or icy, but too much fat can make it greasy. A balance of around
          10-20% fat is ideal for most recipes.</p>
